# Spam Email Classifier

For this project, we are developing a Spam Email classifier to filter out emails using Natural language processing methods

## Problem Description

Understanding the problem is a crucial first step in solving any machine learning problem. In this article, we will explore and understand the process of classifying emails as spam or not spam. This is called Spam Detection, and it is a binary classification problem.
The reason to do this is simple: by detecting unsolicited and unwanted emails, we can prevent spam messages from creeping into the userâ€™s inbox, thereby improving user experience.

With the ever growing number of users, emails are set to increase to a record high, but the worst part of that is, out of that approximately 57 % emails are of no use as they are spam emails.

In my project, I will be using Enron Email database to identify and classify spam emails. Enron corporation was an energy company which came into the spotlight in 2001 due to accounting frauds
and emails of many executives and was made publicly available.
